The **bufferwizard** Emacs package offers a suite of helper functions:
- **Highlight symbol:** `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)`: Toggles highlighting for the symbol at point. If a selection is active, it highlights the selected text instead. This function checks whether the symbol at point or the selected text is currently highlighted. If it is, the highlight is removed; otherwise, it is applied. (This serves as a lightweight alternative to the `highlight-symbol` package.)
- **Replace symbol:** `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)`: Replace occurrences of a symbol at point with a specified string.
- **Clone buffer:** `(bufferwizard-clone-indirect-buffer)` and `(bufferwizard-clone-and-switch-to-indirect-buffer)`: These functions are enhanced versions of the built-in `clone-indirect-buffer`. They create an indirect buffer with the same content as the current buffer while preserving the point position, window start, and horizontal scroll position. This package also provides the `(bufferwizard-switch-to-base-buffer)` function, which allows switching from an indirect buffer to its corresponding base buffer.
- **Hightlight TODO:** `(bufferwizard-hl-todo-mode)`: Automatically highlight codetags (such as TODO, FIXME, BUG, NOTE) in your buffers using custom font-lock rules.
- **Paste indented text:** `(bufferwizard-paste-indented)`: Paste text from the clipboard while matching the current line's indentation. It unindents the clipboard content by removing the minimal common leading whitespace and aligns it perfectly with the cursor's current physical column.
- **Point navigation:**
  - `(bufferwizard-point-backward-to-lower-indentation)` and `(bufferwizard-point-forward-to-lower-indentation)`: Move the point backward or forward to the nearest line with a lower indentation level.
  - `(bufferwizard-point-backward-to-empty-line)` and `(bufferwizard-point-forward-to-empty-line)`: Move the point backward or forward to the nearest empty line.
  - (Setting: When non-nil, the `bufferwizard-point-ignore-invisible` variable causes `bufferwizard-point-*` commands to skip invisible text.)

## Installation

### Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install `bufferwizard` with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package bufferwizard
  :straight (bufferwizard
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/bufferwizard.el"))
```

### Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install `bufferwizard` with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package bufferwizard
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/bufferwizard.el"
       :rev :newest))
```

### Customizations

#### Codetags highlighting

You can customize the codetags that get highlighted by modifying the `bufferwizard-hl-todo-keywords` variable. By default, it highlights `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, `XXX` (with warning face, which is generally red) and `NOTE`, `HACK`, `DONE` (with doc face, which is generally green).

To enable this feature globally, add the following to your Emacs configuration:
```elisp
(bufferwizard-hl-todo-mode 1)
```

#### Case sensitivity

The functions `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)` and `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)` depend on built-in functions that can be customized via the following variable:

- `case-fold-search`: This buffer-local variable determines the behavior of `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)` and `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)`. When set to t (default), both symbol highlighting and searches become case-insensitive, matching symbols regardless of case. When set to nil, they become case-sensitive, matching symbols only when the case exactly matches the text in the buffer.
  Example:
  ```elisp
  ;; Setting case-fold-search to nil enables case-sensitive symbol highlighting
  ;; and search/replace
  (setq-default case-fold-search nil)
  ```

- `case-replace`: When non-nil, this variable ensures that `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)` preserves the case of the original text during replacements.
  Example:
  ```elisp
  ;; t means (bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point) should preserve case in
  ;; replacements.
  (setq case-replace t)
  ```

- [buffer-guardian.el](https://github.com/jamescherti/buffer-guardian.el): Automatically saves Emacs buffers without requiring manual intervention. By default, it triggers a save when the user switches to another buffer, switches to another window or frame, Emacs loses focus, or the minibuffer is opened. Beyond standard file buffers, *buffer-guardian* also manages specialized editing buffers such as *org-src* and *edit-indirect*. Additional features, disabled by default, include periodic or idle-time saving of all buffers, automatic exclusion of remote, nonexistent, or large files, and support for custom exclusion rules via regular expressions or predicate functions.
